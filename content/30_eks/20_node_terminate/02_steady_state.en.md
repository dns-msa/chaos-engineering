Before we begin a failure experiment, we need to validate the user experience and revise the dashboard and metrics to understand that the systems are working under normal state, in other words, *steady state*.

Let's go ahead and explore our Sock Shop application.
Some things to try out:

+ Register and log in using the below credentials (These are very secure so please don't share them)
    - **Username:** `user`
    - **Password:** `password`
+ View various items
+ Add items to cart
+ Remove items from cart
+ Check out items

This is the steady state of our application that we want to compare our user experience as we start experiments.
